# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Steps to Push Your Project to GitHub

1. Initialize a git repository in your project folder:
```
cd d:\Stocks\volume_capture
git init
```

2. Add all files to git staging:
```
git add .
```

3. Create the initial commit:
```
git commit -m "Initial commit: Nifty Options Chain Collector"
```

4. Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/Ashu135/stock-option-chain-collector.git
```

5. Push your code to the main branch (GitHub now uses 'main' as the default branch name):
```
git push -u origin main
```

If you get an error about the 'main' branch not existing, try:
```
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you encounter authentication issues:
1. Use a personal access token instead of password
2. Or set up SSH authentication

### If you encounter a rejected push (non-fast-forward):
This might happen if the remote repository has files like a README or LICENSE that you don't have locally:
```
git pull --rebase origin main
git push -u origin main
```

### If you want to force push (use with caution, only if you're sure):
```
git push -f origin main
```

## Verifying Your Push
After pushing, open your GitHub repository in a browser to verify that all files were uploaded correctly:
